Just a simple calculator for the game Clash of Clans. You will know how to use after trying it once.

It's used to calculate how long it takes to reach the xp level you want to reach from your current level by donating to alt (or clanmates') accounts (making and managing alts is your work though) having certain Clan Castle Levels.

Followings are the inputs you have to give on the website:
1. You input your initial xp and last xp (xp you want to calculate xp for).
2. Next you give the number of each Clan Castle Level (TH level is written next to it) you can donate to (this is a collapsible section).
3. Number of iterations you will be doing in a day. (Once iteration means filling the clan castle of each account you donate to once)
4. There will then be an output after pressing the submit button that you can copy and milestones below that (no copy button for milestones).
5. At the bottom, there is another collapsible section. In this one, you can write the number of days you want to reach the required level in and the result will give the number of iterations you have to do in day.
